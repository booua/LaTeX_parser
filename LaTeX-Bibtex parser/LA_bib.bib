  Abstract                 = {Uniform circular arrays (UCAs) with 360° azimuthal coverage are very useful for structural health monitoring (SHM) of large planar structures. Difficulties encountered when working with {L}amb waves include their dispersive and multi-modal nature. In this article three different methods for estimating the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of incoming {L}amb waves are compared and verified using simulated and experimental data. The previously proposed phase-mode excitation-based beamformer is compared with two high-resolution spectral estimation techniques, the Capon method and the multiple signal classification method. Design consideration and guidelines for UCAs are presented. To experimentally evaluate the performance of the considered DOA methods a prototype array consisting of 16 separate pinducers arranged in a ring was constructed. The array was provided with an analog multiplexer that enabled recording signals received by the individual elements using a digital oscilloscope. The array was used for the reception of ultrasonic pulses sent by broadband piezoelectric transmitters and propagating in an aluminum plate. A selection of simulation and experimental results is presented showing the superior performance of the Capon beamformer.},

  Abstract                 = {Lamb waves have proven to be very useful for plate inspection because large areas of a plate can be covered from a fixed position. This capability makes them suitable for both inspection and structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. During the last decade, research on the use of active arrays in combination with beamforming techniques has shown that a fixed array can be used to perform omni-directional monitoring of a plate structure. The dispersion and multiple propagating modes are issues that need to be addressed when working with Lamb waves. Previous work has mainly focused on conventional, delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, while reducing the effects of multiple modes through frequency selectivity and transducer design. The paper describes an adaptive beamforming technique using a minimum variance distortionless response beamforming (MVBF) approach for spatial Lamb wave filtering with multiple-transmitterâ€“multiple-receiver arrays. Dispersion is compensated for by using theoretically calculated dispersion curves. Simulations are used for evaluating the performance of the technique for suppression of interfering Lamb modes, both with and without the presence of mode conversion using different array configurations. A simple simulation model of the plate is used to compare the performance of different sizes of active arrays. An aluminum plate with artificial defects is used for the experimental evaluation. The results show that the MVBF approach performs a lot better in terms of resolution and suppression of interfering modes than the widely used standard beamformer.},

  Abstract                 = {Many aerospace, civil and mechanical systems continue to be used despite ageing and the associated potential for damage accumulation. Therefore, the ability to monitor the structural health of these systems is becoming increasingly important. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools is available. However, damage identification based upon changes in vibration characteristics is one of the few methods that monitor changes in the structure on a global basis. A summary of developments in the field of global structural health monitoring that have taken place over the last thirty years is first presented. Vibration-based damage detection is a primary tool that is employed for this monitoring. Next, the process of vibration based damage detection will be described as a problem in statistical pattern recognition. This process is composed of three portions: (i) data acquisition and cleansing; (ii) feature selection and data compression; and (iii) statistical model development. Current research regarding feature selection and statistical model development will be emphasized with the application of this technology to a large-scale laboratory structure.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this paper is to show that time reversal invariance can be exploited in acoustics to create a variety of useful instruments as well as elegant experiments in pure physics. Section 1 is devoted to the description of time reversal cavities and mirrors together with a comparison between time reversal and phase conjugation. To illustrate these concepts, several experiments conducted in multiply scattering media, waveguides and chaotic cavities are presented in section 2. Applications of time reversal mirrors (TRMs) in hydrodynamics are then presented in section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the application of TRMs in pulse echo detection. A complete theory of the iterative time reversal mode is presented. It will be explained how this technique allows for focusing on different targets in a multi-target medium. Another application of pulse echo TRMs is presented in this section: how to achieve resonance in an elastic target? Section 5 explores the medical applications of TRMs in ultrasonic imaging, lithotripsy and hyperthermia and section 6 shows the promising applications of TRMs in nondestructive testing of solid samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Localized and distributed guided ultrasonic waves array systems offer an efficient way for the long-term monitoring of the structural integrity for large structures. The use of permanently attached sensor arrays has been shown to be applicable to detect simulated corrosion damage. However, the detection sensitivity for fatigue cracks depends on the location and orientation of the crack relative to the transducer elements. Crack-like defects have a directivity pattern of the scattered wave field depending on the angle of the incident wave relative to the defect orientation and on the ratio of the characteristic defect size to wavelength. From FE simulations it has been shown that for cracks and notches almost no energy is scattered in certain directions from the defect, i.e., the data processing algorithm must take into account that for some transducer combinations no change in the signal even for a significant defect will be detected. The directivity pattern of the scattered field for the A 0 Lamb wave mode is predicted from 3D Finite Element simulations and verified from experimental measurements at machined part-through and through-thickness notches using a laser interferometer. Good agreement was found and the directivity pattern can be predicted accurately. The amplitude of the scattered wave is quantified for a variation of the angle of the incident wave relative to the defect orientation, the defect depth, and the ratio of the characteristic defect size to wavelength. These results provide the basis for the quantification of the detection sensitivity for defects in plate structures using guided wave array sensors. A hybrid model has been developed, taking the different propagation distances and scattering characteristics into account, in order to predict the relative amplitudes of received pulses for given sensor locations. From a comparison with the signal to noise ratio of the array system, detection capabilities can be predicted for given defect size and orientation.},

First, a pitch-catch method using a pair of piezoelectric actuator and sensor is introduced to generate a damage indeX which can be used to characterize damage at a known location. Tests on airbus fuselage panels are conducted to verify the method and damage indeX. The damage indeX relates changes in the energy content of a specific Lamb wave mode selected by group velocity analysis to the eXtent of damage. Second, an imaging method based on multiple pitch-catch information, a network of piezoelectric actuator/sensors, is presented for characterizing damage (location and size) without need for a structural or damage model. The imaging method with an autofocusing feature is applied to aluminum plates and a stiffened composite panel for method verification.},

  Abstract                 = {A piezoelectric based built-in diagnostic technique has been developed for monitoring fatigue crack growth in metallic structures. The technique uses diagnostic signals, generated from nearby piezoelectric actuators built into the structures, to detect crack growth. It consists of three major components: diagnostic signal generation, signal processing and damage interpretation. In diagnostic signal generation, appropriate ultrasonic guided {L}amb waves were selected for actuators to maximize receiving sensor measurements. In signal processing, methods were developed to select an individual mode for damage detection and maximize signal to noise ratio in recorded sensor signals. Finally, in damage interpretation, a physics based damage index was developed relating sensor measurements to crack growth size. Fatigue tests were performed on laboratory coupons with a notch to verify the proposed technique. The damage index measured from built-in piezoceramics on the coupons showed a good correlation with the actual fatigue crack growth obtained from visual inspection. Furthermore, parametric studies were also performed to characterize the sensitivity of sensor/actuator location for the proposed technique.},

  Abstract                 = {{L}amb waves are extensively involved in plate structure inspection because of their guided nature. However, their dispersive nature often limits their use in flaw detection. In this paper we show that the use of a time-reversal mirror (TRM) allows to automatically compensate for the dispersive nature of {L}amb waves. Experiments showing the spatial and temporal behavior of time-reversed {L}amb waves, demonstrate the ability of TRMs to self-focus and to recompress dispersive pulses. This is demonstrated in a set of experiments in which a broadband ultrasonic laser source is used to simulate a point {L}amb wave source and an optical interferometer is used to map the time reversed elastic field. We also show that TRM may work in pulse echo mode and allows to detect and to focus along large 2-D plates on any flaws located in the inspected area },

  Abstract                 = {Air-coupled ultrasonics is fine alternative for the immersion testing technique. Usually a through transmission and a pitch–catch arrangement of ultrasonic transducers are used. The pitch–catch arrangement is very attractive for non-destructive testing and evaluation of materials, because it allows one-side access to the object. However, this technique has several disadvantages. It is sensitive to specularly reflected and edge waves. A spatial resolution depends on a distance between the transducers. A new method for detection and visualisation of inhomogeneities in composite materials using one-side access air-coupled ultrasonic measurement technique is described. Numerical predictions of Lamb wave interaction with a defect in a composite material are carried out and the interaction mechanism is explained. Experimental measurements are carried out with different arrangements of the transducers. The proposed method enables detect delamination and impact type defects in honeycomb materials. },

  Abstract                 = { In ultrasonic nondestructive testing, the iterative time-reversal process is an adaptive technique that can be used to detect flaws in complex samples with a large array of transducers. The decomposition of the time-reversal operator (DORT) method is a detection technique that is derived from the mathematical analysis of the iterative time-reversal process. Contrary to time-reversal techniques, the DORT method does not require programmable generators, and it allows the simultaneous detection and separation of several defects. In this paper, the method is applied to a Ti6-4 titanium cylindrical sample to separate the echo of a defect from the speckle due to microstructure contribution. The grain structure of this titanium alloy makes detection very difficult and, for large depths, conventional techniques do not allow the detection of small flaws with a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio. The efficiency of the DORT method to detect a flat bottom hole with a diameter of 0.4 mm located at a depth of 140 mm in a titanium alloy sample is shown.},

According to the time reversal acoustics, an input signal can be reconstructed at an excitation point if an output signal recorded at another point is reversed in a time domain and emitted back to the original source point. This concept of time reversal is extended to {L}amb wave propagation in order to detect crack damage in plate-like structures such as bridge steel girders.},

This wavelet is complex, yet is able to give quasi-isotropic wavelet phase spectra. All seven wavelets were applied to synthetic and real data to test their ability to reproduce the Fourier spectrum: the Fan, Halo and Morlet wavelets reproduced this spectrum exactly; the Poisson wavelet performed very poorly.

  Abstract                 = {It is desirable for any structural health monitoring (SHM) system to have maximum sensitivity with minimum sensor density. The structural health monitoring system described here is based on the excitation and reception of guided waves using piezoelectric elements as sensors. One of the main challenges faced is that in all but the most simple structures the wave interactions become too complex for the time domain signals to be interpreted directly. One approach to overcoming this complexity is to subtract a baseline reference signal from the measured system when it is known to be defect free. This strategy enables changes in the structure to be identified. Two key issues must be addressed to allow this paradigm to become a reality. First, the system must be sufficiently sensitive to small reflections from defects such as cracking. Second, it must be able to distinguish between benign changes and those due to structural defects. In this paper the baseline subtraction approach is used to detect defects in a simple rectangular plate. The system is shown to work well in the short term, and good sensitivity to defects is demonstrated. The performance degrades over the medium to long term. The principal reason for this degradation is shown to be the effect of change in temperature of the system. These effects are quantified and strategies for overcoming them are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {{L}amb waves have great potential for structural damage detection in many engineering areas. However, the method requires some experience when complex structures are monitored. Deciding the optimal positions of transducers is one of the most important problems.

The problem is investigated using the local interaction simulation approach for {L}amb wave propagation modelling in an aluminium plate with a rectangular damage slot and a fatigue crack. The study demonstrates that sensor location is important for clarity and physical understanding of propagating wave packages, good signal-to-noise ratio and reliable damage detection.

  Abstract                 = {{L}amb waves are the most widely used acousto-ultrasonic guided waves for damage detection. The method is generally complicated by the coexistence of at least two highly dispersive modes at any given frequency. Furthermore pure {L}amb wave modes may generate a variety of other modes by interacting with defects and/or by crossing different boundaries. Knowledge and understanding of {L}amb wave propagation is important for reliable damage detection. However, the theoretical analysis of guided wave scattering forms an extremely difficult problem. This paper reports an application of the local interaction simulation approach for wave propagation in metallic structures. The focus of the analysis is on damage detection applications. The study also involves wave propagation in a piezoceramic actuator/sensor diffusion bond model in which one of the piezoceramics generates the thickness mode vibration. The simulated results are validated experimentally. The results show the potential of the method for wave propagation analysis in damage detection applications.},

The technique is based on guided ultrasonic waves introduced into a structure at one point and sensed at a different location. Damage in a structure is identified by a change in the output signal.

Therefore a knowledge and understanding of wave propagation can ease the interpretation of damage detection results.

Presented here is a methodology for applying diffuse ultrasonic waves to the problem of detecting structural damage in the presence of unmeasured temperature changes. This methodology is based upon the prediction and observation that the first order effect of a temperature change on a diffuse ultrasonic wave is a time dilation or compression. A multi-step procedure is implemented to (1) record a set of baseline waveforms from the undamaged specimen at temperatures spanning the expected operating range, (2) select a waveform from the baseline set whose temperature is the closest to that of a subsequently measured signal, (3) adjust this baseline waveform to best match the signal, and (4) calculate an error parameter between the signal and the adjusted waveform and compare this parameter to a threshold to determine the structural status. This procedure is applied to experimental data from aluminum plate specimens with artificial flaws. Probability of detection and the minimum flaw size detected are presented as a function of the size of the baseline waveform set. It is shown that a probability of detection of over 95% can be achieved with a small number of baseline waveforms.},

  Abstract                 = {The propagation of Lamb waves generated by piezoelectric transducers in a one-dimensional structure has been studied comprehensively in part I of this two-paper series. Using the information embedded in the propagating waveforms, we expect to make a decision on whether damage has occurred; however, environmental and operational variances inevitably complicate the problem. To better detect the damage under these variances, we present in this paper a robust and quantitative decision-making methodology involving advanced signal processing and statistical analysis. In order to statistically evaluate the features in Lamb wave propagation in the presence of noise, we collect multiple time series (baseline signals) from the undamaged beam. A combination of the improved adaptive harmonic wavelet transform (AHWT) and the principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on the baseline signals to highlight the critical features of Lamb wave propagation in the undamaged structure. The detection of damage is facilitated by comparing the features of the test signal collected from the test structure (damaged or undamaged) with the features of the baseline signals. In this process, we employ Hotelling's T 2 statistical analysis to first purify the baseline dataset and then to quantify the deviation of the test data vector from the baseline dataset. Through experimental and numerical studies, we systematically investigate the proposed methodology in terms of the detectability (capability of detecting damage), the sensitivity (with respect to damage severity and excitation frequency) and the robustness against noises. The parametric studies also validate, from the signal processing standpoint, the guidelines of Lamb-wave-based damage detection developed in part I.},

A correlation function was further established, which helped identify the crack position based on a triangulation approach with the aid of a nonlinear least-squares optimization algorithm. Such an approach provides satisfactory results in locating the crack position in aluminium plates with cracks of 5 and 20 mm in length.},

Lamb waves reflected and transmitted by cracks of finite size were assessed to obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients subject to crack orientation, with the aid of a Hilbert transform. Using this relationship, crack orientation was quantitatively determined by evaluating the different amplitudes of energy peaks in the Hilbert spectra.

  Abstract                 = {A method for damage localization based on the phased array idea has been developed. Four arrays of transducers are used to perform a beam-forming procedure. Each array consists of nine transducers placed along a line, which are able to excite and register elastic waves. The A0 Lamb wave mode has been chosen for the localization method. The arrays are placed in such a way that the angular difference between them is 45° and the rotation point is the middle transducer, which is common for all the arrays. The idea has been tested on a square aluminium plate modeled by the Spectral Element Method. Two types of damage were considered, namely distributed damage, which was modeled as stiffness reduction, and cracks, modeled as separation of nodes between selected spectral elements. The plate is excited by a wave packet. The whole array system is placed in the middle of the plate. Each linear phased array in the system acts independently and produces maps of a scanned field based on the beam-forming procedure. These maps are made of time signals (transferred to space domain) that represent the difference between the damaged plate signals and those from the intact plate. An algorithm was developed to join all four maps. The final map is modified by proposed signal processing algorithm to indicate the damaged area of the plate more precisely. The problem for damage localization was investigated and exemplary maps confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system were obtained. It was also shown that the response of the introduced configuration removes the ambiguity of damage localization normally present when a linear phased array is utilized. The investigation is based exclusively on numerical data.},

The performance of the SHM system is evaluated based on the probability of detection (POD). This optimization problem was formulated to maximize the POD through selection of optimal sensor locations for a given sensor network. A genetic algorithm was adopted and integrated with the SHM system to perform the optimization process. Numerical simulations on two composite panels showed that the selection of sensor network configuration is crucial for the performance of the SHM system. For a targeted POD, the proposed method can be used to configure an SHM system with a minimal number of sensors to identify impact forces that are greater than a pre-defined critical value.},

  Abstract                 = {Imaging algorithms recently developed in ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) have shown good potential for defect characterization. Many of them are based on the concept of collecting the full matrix of data, obtained by firing each element of an ultrasonic phased array independently, while collecting the data with all elements. Because of the finite sound velocity in the test structure, 2 consecutive firings must be separated by a minimum time interval. Depending on the number of elements in a given array, this may become problematic if data must be collected within a short time, as it is often the case, for example, in an industrial context. An obvious way to decrease the duration of data capture is to use a sparse transmit aperture, in which only a restricted number of elements are used to transmit ultrasonic waves. This paper compares 2 approaches aimed at producing an image on the basis of restricted data: the common source method and the effective aperture technique. The effective aperture technique is based on the far-field approximation, and no similar approach exists for the near-field. This paper investigates the performance of this technique in near-field conditions, where most NDT applications are made. First, these methods are described and their point spread functions are compared with that of the total focusing method (TFM), which consists of focusing the array at every point in the image. Then, a map of efficiency is given for the different algorithms in the nearfield. The map can be used to select the most appropriate algorithm. Finally, this map is validated by testing the different algorithms on experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates the time reversal process (TRP) of {L}amb wave signals which are transmitted and received by piezoelectric transducers bonded on plate-like structures. A number of previous studies have paid attention to spatial and temporal refocusing capability of an original excitation through the TRP in highly dispersive and complex media. However, when the TRP is applied to {L}amb waves in a homogeneous regular waveguide, the refocusing capability is limited due to permanent residual side bands even if the duration of the time reversed signal increases. Based on the reciprocity of elastodynamics and linear piezoelectricity, theoretical interpretation is conducted for the main and residual side bands of the reconstructed signal in the time domain. In particular, the interpretation includes the temporal effect of velocity and amplitude dispersions, the existence of multimodes, and the reflections from boundaries during the TRP. Then, numerical and experimental tests are conducted to validate the theoretical findings of this paper. Practical issues for the successful implementation of the TRP of {L}amb waves are briefly addressed as well.},

The time reversal method has been adapted to guided-wave propagation to improve the detectability of local defects in composite plate structures. Specifically, a wavelet-based signal processing technique has been developed to enhance the time reversibility of {L}amb wave in thin composite plates. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental studies in which input signals exerted at piezoelectric (PZT) patches on a quasi-isotropic composite plate are successfully reconstructed by using the time reversal method. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a reference-free damage diagnosis technique based on the time reversal process so that defects can be identified without relying on any past baseline data.},

  Abstract                 = {Among the various schemes being considered for structural health monitoringÂ (SHM), guided waveÂ (GW) testing in particular has shown great promise. While GW testing using hand-held transducers for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) is a well established technology, GW testing for SHM using surface-bonded/embedded piezoelectric wafer transducersÂ (piezos) is relatively in its formative years. Little effort has been made towards a precise characterization of GW excitation using piezos and often the various parameters involved are chosen without mathematical foundation. In this work, a formulation for modeling the transient GW field excited using arbitrary shaped surface-bonded piezos in isotropic plates based on the 3D linear elasticity equations is presented. This is then used for the specific cases of rectangular and ring-shaped actuators, which are most commonly used in GW SHM. Equations for the output voltage response of surface-bonded piezo-sensors in GW fields are derived and optimization of the actuator/sensor dimensions is done based on these. Finally, numerical and experimental results establishing the validity of these models are discussed.},

Distinct zones were identified in B- and D-scans and the sizes of zones were expressed in terms of the width and length of delamination, the probe separation distance, and the probe diameter. B-scans generated through numerical simulations gave an insight and significance of each zone. B- and D-scans were used to estimate the width and length of delaminations, respectively. The estimated width and length of delaminations were found to be in concurrence with the actual values. },

Correlation between the numerically simulated and experimentally obtained B-scans was established. In the B-scan images, different Zones were identified and could be utilized for differentiating the healthy and delaminated T-joints. The length and the width of delamination were computed from traversing the transducers in two orthogonal directions (i.e. called the B-scans, and the D-scans). For the first time, backward propagating mode (called “Turning Lamb Modes”) that are generated at corner of the T-joint was observed and verfied. Using a single linear line scan of the “Turning Lamb Modes”, both the width and length of interface delamination could be computed. In the present study, the experiments were carried out employing air-coupled ultrasonic transducers. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a technique for the analysis of full wavefield data in the wavenumber/frequency domain as an effective tool for damage detection, visualization and characterization. Full wavefield data contain a wealth of information regarding the space and time variation of propagating waves in damaged structural components. Such information can be used to evaluate the response spectrum in the frequency/wavenumber domain, which effectively separates incident waves from reflections caused by discontinuities encountered along the wave paths. This allows removing the injected wave from the overall response through simple filtering strategies, thus highlighting the presence of reflections associated with damage. The concept is first illustrated on analytical and numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are conveniently obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the detection of displacements and/or velocities over a user-defined grid, and it is able to provide the required spatial and time information in a timely manner. Tests performed on a simple aluminum plate with artificially seeded slits simulating longitudinal cracks, and on a disbonded tongue and groove joint, show the effectiveness of the technique and its potentials for the inspection of a variety of structural components.},

  Abstract                 = {The guided wave (GW) field excited by piezoelectric wafers and piezocomposite transducers in carbon-fiber composite materials is experimentally investigated with applications to structural health monitoring. This investigation supports the characterization of the composite long-range variable-length emitting radar (CLoVER) transducer introduced by the authors. A systematic approach is followed where composite configurations with different levels of anisotropy are analyzed. In particular, unidirectional, cross-ply [0/90] 3S and quasi-isotropic [0/45/-45/90] 2S IM7-based composite plates are employed. A combination of laser vibrometry and finite element analysis is used to determine the in-plane wave speed and peak-to-peak amplitude distribution in each substrate considered. The results illustrate the effect of the material anisotropy on GW propagation through the steering effect where the wavepackets do not generally travel along the direction in which they are launched. After characterizing the effect of substrate anisotropy on the GW field, the performance of the CLoVER transducer to detect damage in various composite configurations is explored. It is found that the directionality and geometry of the device is effective in detecting the presence and identifying the location of simulated defects in different composite layups.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study an inverse procedure based on the propagation of guided ultrasonic waves is proposed for the characterization of the elastic material constants of plates. The procedure consists of an optimization problem in which the discrepancy between the dispersion curves obtained through a semi analytical finite element (SAFE) formulation and numerical or experimental dispersion curves is minimized. The numerical dispersion curves were obtained from the application of the commercial finite element analysis software ANSYS. Finally experimental data were obtained by adopting a hybrid broadband laser/PZT ultrasonic set-up in a pitch-catch configuration. For both numerical and experimental data, the joint time-frequency analysis of the continuous wavelet transform was used. The optimization scheme proposed in this study is based on an improved version of the simplex search method. The scheme inputs an initial guess of the material parameters in the SAFE formulation. The values of these parameters are iteratively updated until the discrepancy between the SAFE-based group velocity dispersion curves and the numerical or experimental curves is minimized. The scheme is designed to minimize the discrepancy associated with the lowest symmetric and anti-symmetric order mode simultaneously. The validity of the SAFE method coupled to the inverse procedure scheme is tested to characterize the elastic material properties of a 2.54 mm thick aluminum plate. As the SAFE formulation is valid for waveguides of arbitrary cross-section the paper represents the first step toward the integration of an inversion scheme applicable into the SAFE algorithm to characterize the material properties of waveguides of complex geometries and various boundary conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents the application of ultrasonic guided waves for fatigue crack detection in metallic structures. The study involves a simple fatigue test performed to introduce a crack into an aluminium plate. Lamb waves generated by a low-profile, surface-bonded piezoceramic transducer are sensed using a tri-axis, multi-position scanning laser vibrometer. The results demonstrate the potential of laser vibrometry for simple, rapid and robust detection of fatigue cracks in metallic structures. The method could be used in quality inspection and in-service maintenance of metallic structures in aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering industries.},

Guided wave beam steering from omni-directional transducer arrays. Review of progress in quantitative nondestructive evaluation, vol. 22A. Melville, New York, USA: American Institute of Physics; 2002. p. 761-8], has been demonstrated here. The reconstruction of the material state was carried out by utilizing a phased addition reconstruction algorithm. In addition to the signals from damage sites, the ultrasonic guided wave-based reconstruction procedures also need the complete set of elastic moduli as a continuous input throughout the SHM process. In the present study, two flexible printed circuit board (PCB)-based patches: ((i). single-quadrant, double-ring STMR material characterization (MC) array and (ii). Full-ring STMR SHM array) were developed for accomplishing both objectives, i.e. (a) online MC and (b) SHM of anisotropic plate-like structures, respectively. Experiments were conducted on 3.15 mm graphite-epoxy composite plate using PCB-based STMR arrays, the feasibility of accomplishing both objectives was demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an experimental and theoretical investigation of the applicability of the time-reversal concept to guided waves in plate-like structures, where the stress waves are dispersive and of multi-modes. It is shown that temporal and spatial focusing can be achieved through time reversal, although the dispersive behaviour of the flexural waves renders it impossible to exactly reconstruct the waveform of the original excitation. Based on the principle of the time-reversal concept, a digital imaging method suitable for distributed sensor/actuator networks has been developed. This new method, which overcomes the limitation of the conventional phased array method that operates under pulse-echo mode, provides an efficient imaging method for locating and approximate sizing of structural damages. In addition, it has been shown that signal strengths can be considerably enhanced by applying the present synthetic time-reversal method, thus reducing the number of sensors and actuators required to achieve a given signal-to-noise ratio.},

A signal processing technique is presented that enables this constraint on operating point to be relaxed. The technique makes use of a priori knowledge of the dispersion characteristics of a guided wave mode to map signals from the time to distance domains. In the mapping process, dispersed signals are compressed to their original shape. The theoretical basis of the technique is described and an efficient numerical implementation is presented. The robustness of the technique to inaccuracies in the dispersion data is also addressed. The application of the technique to experimental data is shown and the resulting improvement in spatial resolution is demonstrated. The implications of using dispersion compensation in practical systems are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {A damage detection method based on an innovative 2D phased sensor array made of piezoelectric paint is proposed for in situ damage detection of a thin isotropic panel using guided {L}amb waves. A design analysis of candidate 2D arrays based on spiral, cruciform and circular element layouts is performed. In this study, a 2D phased sensor array with a spiral configuration is fabricated using a piezoelectric composite (piezopaint) patch and used for detecting damages in an aluminum panel. Steered array responses are generated from the raw sensor signals using a directional filtering algorithm based on phased array signal processing. The fundamental flexural (or transverse), A0 mode, of the guided {L}amb waves is used though the sensing and analysis technique is not limited to the mode used in this work. To enhance the proposed analysis technique, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) are applied. A new damage detection algorithm including threshold setting and damage index (DI) calculation is developed and implemented for detecting damages in the form of holes and a simulated crack. The characteristic damage indices consistently increase as damage size grows.},

  Abstract                 = {Lamb waves are dispersive and multi-modal, which makes the interpretation of Lamb wave signals very difficult in either the time or frequency domain. In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain. The space-frequency-wave number analysis has successfully been used for the study of wave interaction with structural discontinuity and crack detection on an aluminum plate.},
